OpenGL Intro Assignment (CSC3020H Assignment 3)
Author: Mike James White (WHTMIC023)

A simple OpenGL program which allows a user to load up to 2 models at a time and perform various transformations.

Run using 'make run' and then enter a path, in the terminal, to the first model to load (path is relative to the root project folder).

CONTROLS:
=========

Transformations:

  'A' - Scale on all axis.

  'S' - Scale on an individual axis (tap S again to toggle between these axis).

  'T' - Translate on an individual axis (tap T again to toggle between these axis).

  'R' - Rotate on an individual axis (tap R again to toggle between these axis).

  The mouse is used to drive all transformations by capturing the y axis movement.

Other:

  'P' - Party Mode! (Colour changing functionality - toggleable)

  'N' - Load in a second file (Specify the path in the terminal).
